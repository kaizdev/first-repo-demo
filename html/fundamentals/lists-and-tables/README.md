# Lists and Tables




## Why do we use these structured html elements?
- It might be easier to programatically generate content into a list or table (e.g. data coming externally)
- It is also semantic for adaptive technologies


### Lists
- Lists of data may make semantic sense i.e. ingredients in a recipe or steps in a guide





### Tables
- Sometimes it makes sense to semantically for this content to be in a table
- Can be used for layout -> although this is not commonly used anymore -> better choices exist such as grid, flex box
    - In the early web days table layouts were pretty common
