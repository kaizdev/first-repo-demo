# HTML Conventions
Standardised ways to write the code (universally accepted as best practice)


## WHy do we need to follow code style conventions?
- Easier to read
- Make collaboration easier
- Tracking mistakes and bugs
- Maintenance / making change

## What are some universal "best practices" for writing HTML?
- Use of semantics
- Indenting child elements
- Comments
- use meaningful names for classes and IDs (pick a convention e.g. BEM. e.g ID called submit-user-button.... NOT button)
- (debateable) use stylesheets over inline styles
- always close tags
- lowercase tag names
- use correct casing for classes and IDs
