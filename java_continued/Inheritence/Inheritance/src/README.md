## What is inheritance?

-   to receive something, usually from a parent
-   let's say we have 2 or more classes
-   they share certain functionality
-   Create something called a Parent class
-   Child class can extend the parent class -> they will inherit all the methods and public and protected fields from the parent class
-   Child class can do everything from parent + any additional that they have
