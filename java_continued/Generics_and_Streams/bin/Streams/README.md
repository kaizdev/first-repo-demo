# Streams

## What are streams?

-   very similar to JavaScript iterators
-   Allow us to perform operations on a sequence of elements
-   .filter (similar to JS)
-   .map (similar to JS)
-   .mapToInt
-   .reduce (different from JS)

## Use / Implementation

-   Before we use any of the methods, we need to turn our data structure, like Array, ArrayList, to a _String_.
-   String is a wrapper around a data source
-   e.g. a pipeline through which data flows

## Why use Streams?

-   Similar reasons to why we would use iterators in JavaScript
-   more readable code
-   less chance of bugs (no need for indexes)
-   _In Java, Streams could be more efficient than loops (performant)_

-   we can chain all the operations into 1
