        <!--* 1. What is unit testing? -->
        <!-- Unit testing - A small , isolated piece of our code, usually a function -->
        <!-- Given some inputs - gives the expected return, or error (if wrong info) -->
        <!-- JEST - a js testing library -->

        <!--* 2. Why do we test our code? -->
        <!-- Make sure that it works as intended. Check if there are any bugs -->
        <!-- Test functions with different inputs -->
        <!-- Verify the correctness of our code and detect bugs early -->
        <!-- Tests are something we do in the development phase -->
        <!-- Jest is a development dependency -->
        <!-- Makes code easier to maintain and refactor -->
        <!-- Good tests work as documentation (spec for what the function should be doing) -->

        <!--* 3. What is TDD? -->
        <!-- Test driven development -->
        <!-- Write tests before writing the code e.g. todo app - requirements for what the app does-->
        <!-- Allow user to add new todo, allow user to delete todo, etc. -->

        <!--* 4. What are the advantages of TDD? -->
        <!-- Early bug detection, code documentation -->
        <!-- Easier to collaborate in a team -->
        <!-- Forces us to think of every possible scenario -->
        <!-- Different when thinking of the test first -> less bias when compared to code first, then test -->
        <!-- We are forced to write function with less responsibility, that do one thing at a time, more modular -->

        <!--* 5. How to set up tests? -->
        <!-- 5.1 - Install Jest -->
        <!-- 5.2 - Add the test:jest script to package.json -->
        <!-- 5.3 - Install babel - compiler - translates one version of JS to a different version of JS. Tests run in node, and node uses exports like this: module.export = {something} -->
        <!-- const myModule = require("./file") -->
        <!-- myModule.something -->

        <!-- Instead, babel allows browser import export -->
        <!-- export const myFunction = () => {} -->
        <!-- import {something} from "./file.js" -->
        <!-- .4 - create a babel config js file -->
