# Nest JS

## What is Nest?

-   A backend framework built in TypeScript (plain JS works too but lends itself to TS)
-   Extremely modular

    -   We can use lots of different ORMs and databases
    -   we can build different types of applications

-   By default, it is built on top of Express -> a node js framework (can choose Fastify)
-   Runs in Node
-   Has a Spring like file structure

## Why do we use Nest?

-   Because it's so similar to Spring
-   Because it's easy/cheap to deploy (vs JVM). Spring is more powerful and faster, but uses more resources
-   All Js/TS stack. Using TS on front end anyway
    -   Less context switching
-   Because it has _great_ documentation
