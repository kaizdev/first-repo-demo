# Context

## In general

-   Relevant information (may help understanding)
-   Details about where something happens

## In React

-   About passing relevant data to components
-   Doesn't necessarily have to be state that is passed
-   However, often used to pass State to deeply nested components

-   What does context solve? We might send state through a component which doesn't use that state, but is required to keep passing it down
