# Partials and Modules

## What are they?

-   Separate files we can use to contain parts of our stylesheet

## Why do we use them?

-   Maintenance - it's easier to work on a small tightly scoped file than a large one
-   Avoid merge conflicts - particularly useful in collaborative work (work on a project at the same time e.g. adjust a button, adjust a heading)
-   Mentally easier to work with small files
-   It lends more towards a component based mindset - this is what frontend looks like these days
